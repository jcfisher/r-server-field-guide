# Welcome

This is the website for *The Field Guide to R in Server Enivronments*.  As R is increasingly used for high-performance computing, users may find that the jump from using R on a personal computer to using it on a server is larger than they might have assumed.  This book should make that transition easier.

In this guide, I explain how to write R code & submit batch jobs in a variety of server environments.  Specifically, I focus on three main types of server environments:

1. Single-server environments
2. Multiple-server environments with schedule

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
